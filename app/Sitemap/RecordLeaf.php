/**
 * Kind A — the opt-in record leaf. Projects the owner-edited {@see SitemapRecord} rows
 * into NavItems via their `extract()` projection. This is the ONLY leaf that touches the
 * database, so a clone that never opts in (never adds this leaf to a section) pays nothing.
 *
 * Runtime-merge, cache-busted on save (dial #3): the projection is memoised under
 * {@see self::CACHE_KEY}; {@see SitemapRecord::booted()} forgets it on every save/delete,
 * so an owner's Frame edit is reflected on the next request without a rebuild.
 *
 * It is also this host's {@see NavItemSource}, the records the packaged orphaned-nav doctor
 * check validates: {@see navItems()} reads them fresh, never through the cache.
