/**
 * Seeds the 7 auth-page `beam_ux_entries` rows (theme-entries-and-authoring STR-03) —
 * `FortifyServiceProvider` resolves a body for each of these via `Splicewire\Beam\Ux\Support\EntryBody`. Each entry's
 * body is an ordinary composable JsonDoc: a heading + description (today's static copy, as PLAIN
 * editable blocks — an author can retext/delete/reorder them) followed by the sealed island node
 * referencing the real Fortify-bound form (`resources/js/editor/registry.tsx`) — never decomposed.
 * The heading/description carry the SAME `className`s `layouts/auth/auth-simple-layout.tsx`'s own
 * `<h1>`/`<p>` used to render them with, so promoting them into the tree is visually a no-op; the
 * layout's own title/description slot is left blank now that the tree owns this text (`auth/entry.tsx`
 * no longer pushes a hardcoded chrome string via `setLayoutProps` for these 6 pages).
 *
 * `two-factor-challenge` is the one exception: its title/description are session-state-driven (the
 * authentication-code ⇄ recovery-code toggle), not editorial copy, so its tree is the sealed island
 * alone — its own component keeps calling `setLayoutProps` itself, unchanged.
 *
 * There is no package-side disk-seeding mechanism for this (mirrors `ThemeSeeder`'s own rationale):
 * `RegisterEntriesFromDisk` only stores raw `.tsx` source post-Puck-retirement, no structural-tree
 * seeding capability. This host-local seeder is the in-scope fix.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running refreshes each SAME particle's payload (never mints a second orphaned one).

     * grant cascade resolves exactly as before — only the dangling dependency on the retired class is gone.
